# Honest_Tip_Calculator

This app calculates the recommended tip you should pay at a restaurant. 
It considers factors like the cost of the meal, friendliness of the waiter, speed of service, quality of food, your own generosity and ability to pay.

Possibilities for Improvement:

1. Adjust EditText so that keyboard only displays digits for Integer input or digits and decimal point for Double input.
2. Keep TextView, EditText and Button sizes constant. They currently change size depending on what the text says. Perhaps make TextView scrollable?
3. More user-friendly way to enter friendliness, speed, quality, generosity and affordability scores. Since these are limited to 1-5 points, having to use the keyboard to enter them seems unnecessary.
4. I cannot find an autoSize attribute for EditText hint text or Button text, making them look too small on larger devices.
5. Localize so each country/region displays its own currency. Also, adjust tipping algorithm for different countries/regions.
