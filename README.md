# Honest_Tip_Calculator

This app calculates the recommended tip you should pay at a restaurant. 
It considers factors like the cost of the meal, friendliness of the waiter, 
speed of service, quality of food, your own generosity and ability to pay.

Possibilities for Improvement:

1. Keep TextView, EditText and Button sizes constant. They currently change size depending on what the text says. 
Perhaps make TextView scrollable?

2. More user-friendly way to enter friendliness, speed, quality, generosity and affordability scores. 
Since these are limited to 1-5 points, having to use the keyboard to enter them seems unnecessary.

3. I cannot find an autoSize attribute for EditText hint text or Button text, making them look too small on larger devices.

4. Localize so each country/region displays its own currency. 

5. Support different languages.

6. Adjust tipping algorithm for different countries/regions.
